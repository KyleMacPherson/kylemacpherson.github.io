            <p>So it's Monday of lab week at Makers, the first day of the sixth week, and I am making my first blog post. What a guy.</p>

<p>Lab week is the equivalent of reading week at uni, except you actually do some work rather than drinking and playing FIFA. </p>

<p>My priorities for lab week:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Set up a blog to keep track of my goals for lab week - Check!</p></li>
<li><p>Read POODR - I have had this book recommended to me 10+ times over the last few weeks and I now finally have time to read it, so this is priority number one. This should also help with some of my other goals with lab week.</p></li>
<li><p>Review my previous weekend challenges - I have a lot of feedback from various Makers coaches on my previous challenges and I will try to implement that this week, along with some jewels from the boss Sandy Mehtz (see 2).</p></li>
<li><p>The Mihai Challenge - Mihai is, from what I can gather, a legendary Makers student/coach and this is his challenge. He set it for my friend who graduated about 6 months ago who has now persuaded (bullied) me into it. Basically it is the chitter challenge with a twist. More on this when I get to starting it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If by some miracle I manage to finish all of this I will try to finish the awesome JavaScript video series I am watching on Udemy and have a quick run though the Rails course on Codecademy to prepare for week 7.</p>

<p>Good luck me!</p>
