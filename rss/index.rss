What a guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lab week is the equivalent of reading week at uni, except you actually do some work rather than drinking and playing FIFA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My priorities&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://localhost:2368/lab-week-at-makers/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">0d8f6431-1638-4698-b8b1-bb641b846f32</guid><dc:creator>Kyle MacPherson</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Oct 2015 09:04:46 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;So it's Monday of lab week at Makers, the first day of the sixth week, and I am making my first blog post. What a guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lab week is the equivalent of reading week at uni, except you actually do some work rather than drinking and playing FIFA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My priorities for lab week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up a blog to keep track of my goals for lab week - Check!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read POODR - I have had this book recommended to me 10+ times over the last few weeks and I now finally have time to read it, so this is priority number one. This should also help with some of my other goals with lab week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review my previous weekend challenges - I have a lot of feedback from various Makers coaches on my previous challenges and I will try to implement that this week, along with some jewels from the boss Sandy Mehtz (see 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mihai Challenge - Mihai is, from what I can gather, a legendary Makers student/coach and this is his challenge. He set it for my friend who graduated about 6 months ago who has now persuaded (bullied) me into it. Basically it is the chitter challenge with a twist. More on this when I get to starting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If by some miracle I manage to finish all of this I will try to finish the awesome JavaScript video series I am watching on Udemy and have a quick run though the Rails course on Codecademy to prepare for week 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck me!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
